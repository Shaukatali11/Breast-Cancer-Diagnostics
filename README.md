# Breast Cancer Classification Project

## Problem Statement:
The objective of this analysis is to identify influential features for predicting whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign, aiming to guide the selection of machine learning models and hyperparameters. The goal is to build a robust classification model for accurate breast cancer detection.

## Aim of this Project:
This project focuses on classifying breast tumors using various machine learning algorithms. Models, including logistic regression, SVM, KNN, naive Bayes, and decision trees, and many more... are assessed based on accuracy to identify the most effective one for breast cancer prediction.

## Types of Tumors:
1. **Benign Tumor**
    - Non-cancerous
    - Capsulated
    - Non-invasive
    - Slow-growing
    - Does not metastasize
    - Cells are normal

2. **Malignant Tumor**
    - Cancerous
    - Non-capsulated
    - Fast-growing
    - Metastasizes to other parts of the body
    - Cells have large, dark nuclei and may have abnormal shapes

## Approach to Model Development:
1. **Dataset:**
    - Comprehensive dataset containing features related to breast tumors.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
    - Clean and preprocess data.

3. **Train-Test Split:**
    - Split dataset into training and testing sets.

4. **Machine Learning Algorithms:**
    - Utilize various algorithms to build and train classification models.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
    - Evaluate model accuracy and performance metrics.

6. **GitHub Repository:**
    - [Link to GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Shaukatali11/Breast-Cancer-Diagnostics)

## Classification of New Data:
Once the model is trained, classify breast tumors as benign or malignant.
